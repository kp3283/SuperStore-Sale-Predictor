# SuperStore Sales
This is a project where I  I want to find :

1. What is the overall trend of the sales?
2. What are the top 10 products by sales?
3. Which is the most performing Segment?
4. What is the most preferred Ship Mode?
5. Which are the most profitable category and Sub-category?
 
And predict my future sales.

### Data Exploration and Cleaning:

1. We drop the following columns : 'Row ID', 'Customer Name', 'Country', 'Product Name',Order ID' and 'Customer ID'.
2. Date is converted from character to Date format.

### Data Visualization and Analysis:
1. We extract the month and year from the date column to independent columns.
2. Investigating and study the trend of the sale and grouping the data to get monthly sales.Sales per month for each year is plotted.
